# Jay's Eyes
A fork of Shinigami Eyes that marks ableist and disabled/mentally ill-friendly subreddits/users/facebook pages/groups with different colors.
Named for Jayfeather from Warriors, a blind character who is one of the story's main heroes, and has the ability to sense people's emotions and see their memories.

This fork is a work in progress.
